![Undersea cable failures cause Internet disruptions for multiple African
countries](https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image9.png)

On Sunday, May 12, issues with the
[ESSAy](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/eastern-africa-
submarine-system-eassy) and
[Seacom](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/seacomtata-tgn-
eurasia) submarine cables again disrupted connectivity to East Africa,
impacting a number of countries previously affected by a set of cable cuts
that occurred nearly three months earlier.

On February 24, three submarine cables that run through the Red Sea were
damaged: the [Seacom/Tata cable](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-
cable/seacomtata-tgn-eurasia), the [Asia Africa
Europe-1](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/asia-africa-
europe-1-aae-1) (AAE-1), and the [Europe India
Gateway](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/europe-india-
gateway-eig) (EIG). It is
[believed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-06/anchor-from-
houthi-sunk-ship-likely-damaged-undersea-cables) that the cables were cut by
the anchor of the [Rubymar](https://www.wired.com/story/houthi-internet-
cables-ship-anchor-path/), a cargo ship that was damaged by a ballistic
missile on February 18. These cable cuts
[reportedly](https://www.wired.com/story/houthi-internet-cables-ship-anchor-
path/#:~:text=impacted%20countries%20in%20East%20Africa) impacted countries in
East Africa, including
[Tanzania](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/tz?dateStart=2024-02-22&dateEnd=2024-02-28),
[Kenya](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/ke?dateStart=2024-02-22&dateEnd=2024-02-28),
[Uganda](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/ug?dateStart=2024-02-22&dateEnd=2024-02-28),
and
[Mozambique](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/mz?dateStart=2024-02-22&dateEnd=2024-02-28).
As of this writing (May 13), [these cables remain
unrepaired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-07/repairs-to-
damaged-red-sea-internet-cables-delayed-by-yemen-political-splits).

Already suffering from reduced capacity due to the February cable cuts, these
countries were impacted by a second set of cable cuts that occurred on Sunday,
May 12. According to a [social media post from Ben
Roberts](https://twitter.com/benliquidkenya/status/1789622798907843058), Group
CTIO at Liquid Intelligent Technologies in Kenya, faults on the
[EASSy](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/eastern-africa-
submarine-system-eassy) and
[Seacom](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/seacomtata-tgn-
eurasia) cables again disrupted connectivity to East Africa, as he noted “
_All sub sea capacity between East Africa and South Africa is down._ ” A [BBC
article](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cprg0yn8q81o) citing Roberts stated
that the EASSy cable had been cut approximately 45km (28 miles) north of the
South African port city of Durban. A subsequent [press release issued by the
Communications Authority of
Kenya](https://twitter.com/CA_Kenya/status/1790022989913727121) stated that
the cut had occurred at the Mtunzini teleport station (in South Africa). As
seen in the map below, both the EASSy and Seacom cables land in Mtunzini.

## Impacts to country-level Internet traffic

Cloudflare Radar saw traffic levels across a number of the impacted countries
drop just before 11:00 local time (08:00 UTC). As seen in the graphs below,
the magnitude of impact varied by country, with traffic initially dropping by
10-25% in
[Kenya](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/ke?dateStart=2024-05-12),
[Uganda](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/ug?dateStart=2024-05-12),
[Madagascar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/mg?dateStart=2024-05-12),
and
[Mozambique](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/mz?dateStart=2024-05-12),
while traffic in
[Rwanda](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/rw?dateStart=2024-05-12),
[Malawi](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/mw?dateStart=2024-05-12), and
[Tanzania](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/tz?dateStart=2024-05-12)
dropped by one-third or more as compared to the previous week.

In Kenya and Uganda, the overall impact appeared to be low, with traffic
generally remaining just below expected levels in the day and a half following
the cable faults. In the other countries, the overnight trough of the diurnal
traffic patterns remained consistent with the previous week’s traffic levels,
but otherwise traffic remains significantly lower than expected.

## The importance of redundancy

In Kenya, the impact may have been nominal due to steps taken by providers
like Safaricom and Airtel Kenya. In a May 12 social media post, [Safaricom
noted](https://twitter.com/SafaricomPLC/status/1789672918437200266) “ _...We
have since activated redundancy measures to minimise service interruption and
keep you connected as we await the full restoration of the cable._ ” In a
subsequent social media post on May 13, [Safaricom
noted](https://twitter.com/SafaricomPLC/status/1789992420836307292/photo/1) “
_Thanks to our redundancy plans and capacity investment across multiple
undersea cables our services continue to be available, however some customers
may experience slow connectivity and speeds._ ” Similarly, a social media post
from [Airtel Kenya
noted](https://twitter.com/AIRTEL_KE/status/1790097275970019693/photo/1) “
_Following yesterday's undersea fiber cut that has impacted internet
connectivity, we would like to update you that we have taken measures to
improve your browsing experience through additional capacity enhancement._ ”

Similarly, the previously referenced [press
release](https://twitter.com/CA_Kenya/status/1790022989913727121/photo/1) from
the Communications Authority of Kenya talked about actions being taken,
stating “ _Meanwhile, the Authority has directed service providers to take
proactive steps to secure alternative routes for their traffic and is
monitoring the situation closely to ensure that incoming and outbound internet
connectivity is available. The East Africa Marine System (TEAMS) cable, which
has not been affected by the cut, is currently being utilised for local
traffic flow while redundancy on the South Africa route has been activated to
minimise the impact._ ”

## What’s next?

Once the necessary permits are secured and the cable faults are located,
repairs can often be completed in several days. However, because cable repair
ships are [something of a scarce
resource](https://www.iscpc.org/information/cableships-of-the-world/?items=0),
there is [often a delay](https://www.theverge.com/c/24070570/internet-cables-
undersea-deep-repair-ships) to both engage a vessel and for it to travel to
the area where the cable damage occurred, whether from its baseport or the
location of a previous repair. However, in this case that delay may be
comparatively short, as submarine cable industry observer [@philBE2
predicts](https://twitter.com/philBE2/status/1790051184578871524) “ _Expecting
the usual suspect,_[ _CS Leon
Thevenin_](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/8108676) _, now moored
in Cape Town, to be swiftly mobilized for an expeditious repair mission…_ ”

The Cloudflare Radar team will continue to monitor traffic recovery and the
status of Internet connectivity in the impacted countries. We will share our
observations on the [Cloudflare Radar Outage
Center](https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center), via social media, and in
