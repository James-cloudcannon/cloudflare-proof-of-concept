![AI Gateway is generally available: a unified interface for managing and
scaling your generative AI
workloads.](https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image4-3.png)

During Developer Week in April 2024, we announced General Availability of
[Workers AI](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-ai-ga-huggingface-loras-
python-support), and today, we are excited to announce that AI Gateway is
Generally Available as well. Since its launch to beta [in September 2023
during Birthday Week](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-ai-gateway),
we’ve proxied over 500 million requests and are now prepared for you to use it
in production.

AI Gateway is an AI ops platform that offers a unified interface for managing
and scaling your generative AI workloads. At its core, it acts as a proxy
between your service and your inference provider(s), regardless of where your
model runs. With a single line of code, you can unlock a set of powerful
features focused on performance, security, reliability, and observability –
think of it as your [control
plane](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-the-control-
plane/) for your AI ops. And this is just the beginning – we have a roadmap
full of exciting features planned for the near future, making AI Gateway the
tool for any organization looking to get more out of their AI workloads.

proxy](https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image6-1.png)

## Why add a proxy and why Cloudflare?

The AI space moves fast, and it seems like every day there is a new model,
provider, or framework. Given this high rate of change, it’s hard to keep
track, especially if you’re using more than one model or provider. And that’s
one of the driving factors behind launching AI Gateway – we want to provide
you with a single consistent control plane for all your models and tools, even
if they change tomorrow, and then again the day after that.

We've talked to a lot of developers and organizations building AI
applications, and one thing is clear: they want more observability, control,
and tooling around their AI ops. This is something many of the AI providers
are lacking as they are deeply focused on model development and less so on
platform features.

Why choose Cloudflare for your AI Gateway? Well, in some ways, it feels like a
natural fit. We've spent the last 10+ years helping build a better Internet by
running one of the largest global networks, helping customers around the world
with performance, reliability, and security – Cloudflare is used as a [reverse
proxy](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/) by
nearly 20% of all websites. With our expertise, it felt like a natural
progression – change one line of code, and we can help with observability,
reliability, and control for your AI applications – all in one control plane –
so that you can get back to building.

Here is that one line code change using the OpenAI JS SDK. And check out [our
docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/providers/) to reference
other providers, SDKs, and languages.

```
    import OpenAI from 'openai';

    const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
    	baseURL: "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_slug}/openai"
    });
```

## What’s included today?

After talking to customers, it was clear that we needed to focus on some
foundational features before moving onto some of the more advanced ones. While
we're really excited about what’s to come, here are the key features available
in GA today:

**Analytics** : Aggregate metrics from across multiple providers. See traffic
patterns and usage including the number of requests, tokens, and costs over
time.

10-.png)

**Real-time logs:** Gain insight into requests and errors as you build.

![Real-time logs from running three requests to
Cohere](https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image8-1.png)

**Caching:** Enable custom caching rules and use Cloudflare’s cache for repeat
requests instead of hitting the original model provider API, helping you save
on cost and latency.

![Set up rules for caching
requests](https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image1-10.png)

**Rate limiting:** Control how your application scales by limiting the number
of requests your application receives to control costs or prevent abuse.

![Set up rules for rate limiting
traffic](https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image5-9.png)

**Support for your favorite providers:** AI Gateway now natively supports
Workers AI plus 10 of the most popular providers, including [Groq and
Cohere](https://x.com/CloudflareDev/status/1791204770394648901) as of mid-May 2024.

![Real time logs from three LLM providers - Cohere, Groq, and

**Universal endpoint:** In case of errors, improve resilience by defining
[request fallbacks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-
gateway/configuration/fallbacks/) to another model or inference provider.

```

    curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_slug} -X POST \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '[
      {
        "provider": "workers-ai",
        "endpoint": "@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer {cloudflare_token}",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "query": {
          "messages": [
            {
              "role": "system",
              "content": "You are a friendly assistant"
            },
            {
              "role": "user",
              "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "provider": "openai",
        "endpoint": "chat/completions",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer {open_ai_token}",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "query": {
          "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
          "stream": true,
          "messages": [
            {
              "role": "user",
              "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]'
```

## What’s coming up?

We've gotten a lot of feedback from developers, and there are some obvious
things on the horizon such as persistent logs and custom metadata –
foundational features that will help unlock the real magic down the road.

But let's take a step back for a moment and share our vision. At Cloudflare,
we believe our platform is much more powerful as a unified whole than as a
collection of individual parts. This mindset applied to our AI products means
that they should be easy to use, combine, and run in harmony.

Let's imagine the following journey. You initially onboard onto Workers AI to
run inference with the latest open source models. Next, you enable AI Gateway
to gain better visibility and control, and start storing persistent logs. Then
you want to start tuning your inference results, so you leverage your
persistent logs, our prompt management tools, and our built in eval
functionality. Now you're making analytical decisions to improve your
inference results. With each data driven improvement, you want more. So you
implement our feedback API which helps annotate inputs/outputs, in essence
building a structured data set. At this point, you are one step away from a
one-click fine tune that can be deployed instantly to our global network, and
it doesn't stop there. As you continue to collect logs and feedback, you can
continuously rebuild your fine tune adapters in order to deliver the best
results to your end users.

This is all just an aspirational story at this point, but this is how we
envision the future of AI Gateway and our AI suite as a whole. You should be
able to start with the most basic setup and gradually progress into more
advanced workflows, all without leaving [Cloudflare’s AI
platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/ai-solution/). In the end, it might not
look exactly as described above, but you can be sure that we are committed to
providing the best AI ops tools to help make Cloudflare the best place for AI.

## How do I get started?

AI Gateway is available to use today on all plans. If you haven’t yet used AI
Gateway, check out our [developer
documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) and get started
now. AI Gateway’s core features available today are offered for free, and all
it takes is a Cloudflare account and one line of code to get started. In the
future, more premium features, such as persistent logging and secrets
management will be available subject to fees. If you have any questions, reach
